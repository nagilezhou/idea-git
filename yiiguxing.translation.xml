      <item value="he Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that * have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. In normal usage, the client * software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic * interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme. The client * does not know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories, * since it uses only the generic interfaces of their products. This pattern separates the details * of implementation of a set of objects from their general usage and relies on object composition, * as object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface. * * &lt;p&gt;The essence of the Abstract Factory pattern is a factory interface ({@link KingdomFactory}) * and its implementations ( {@link ElfKingdomFactory}, {@link OrcKingdomFactory}). The example uses * both concrete implementations to create a king, a castle and an army." />
