      <item value="&lt;p&gt;It is possible, and in fact common, for a base class to * implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or * instances will hold releasable resources. For code that must operate * in complete generality, or when it is known that the {@code AutoCloseable} * instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use {@code * try}-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as * {@link java.util.stream.Stream} that support both I/O-based and * non-I/O-based forms, {@code try}-with-resources blocks are in * general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms." />
